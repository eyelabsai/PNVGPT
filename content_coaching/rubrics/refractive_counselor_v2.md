(DISC-Aware + Conversion-Intelligence + Commitment Mechanics AI)

**Version:** 2  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-29  
**Applies To:** AI evaluation of patient counselors, coordinators, navigators, and phone operators discussing refractive and cataract surgery possibilities (LASIK, PRK, SMILE, ICL, etc.)

## GOALS OF THE CONSULTATION

The counselor consultation should achieve:

1. **Qualify Interest**
   - Identify true intent vs hesitation
   - Distinguish emotional vs logical blockers
   - Identify DISC communication style early

2. **Educate on Options**
   - Explain procedures clearly without diagnosing
   - Match depth and framing to DISC style
   - Set accurate expectations for exam, surgery, and recovery

3. **Address Financial Concerns**
   - Present cost transparently
   - Clarify insurance, financing, deposits
   - Frame value appropriately without pressure

4. **Build Confidence & Trust**
   - Reduce fear through credibility-based explanation (not reassurance alone)
   - Always validate stated emotions
   - Reinforce clinic competence and safety process ethically

5. **Move to the Next Step**
   - Convert interest into a concrete next action
   - Lock momentum appropriately
   - Ensure verbal commitment translates into logistics

## GLOBAL REQUIREMENT (APPLIES TO ALL PHASES)

**Emotional Validation — MANDATORY**
- Counselor explicitly labels and validates stated emotions (fear, nervousness, hesitation, excitement)
- Validation occurs before explanation, pricing, or closing
- Validation is neutral, non-dismissive, and non-minimizing

**Examples:**
- "That's a very common fear — thanks for saying it out loud."
- "It sounds like safety is really what's holding you back."

**Penalty:** Failure to validate emotions downgrades Discovery and Objection Handling scores.

## REQUIRED ITEMS TO COVER

### 1. DISCOVERY PHASE
(EyeAdvisor: Rapport + Intent Identification)

**Motivation & Context**
- Why is the patient interested now?
- How long have they been considering refractive surgery?
- Current vision correction: Glasses, Contacts, Both; Duration of use (years)
- Daily frustrations with current correction
- Lifestyle and activities affected: Sports, Work, Travel, Hobbies, Night driving

**Knowledge & Readiness**
- Previous research or knowledge about refractive procedures
- Source of lead (doctor referral, online, friend, ad, etc.)
- Expectations entering the consult

**Emotional & Cognitive Drivers**
- Emotional drivers detected: Fear, Excitement, Frustration, Logic/value-driven reasoning
- Primary driver identified: Freedom/lifestyle, Cost avoidance, Convenience, Confidence
- Primary blocker identified: Fear of blindness, Fear of procedure, Cost/value skepticism, Timing/logistics, Trust/credibility uncertainty

**Intent & Hesitation Classification**
- Intent level inferred: Low, Moderate, High
- "Let me think about it" classified as: True indecision, Fear-based hesitation, Value testing, Exit attempt

**Objection Specificity Drilling — REQUIRED**
- When a general objection is raised, counselor nails it down to a specific concern
- Examples: "When you say you need to think about it, what specifically are you unsure about?" "You mentioned talking to your spouse — what do you think she'll say?" "Is her concern more about safety, cost, or timing?"

**Secondary Decision-Maker Handling — REQUIRED**
- Spouse/partner involvement explicitly explored
- Exam positioned as information-gathering for both parties

**DISC Identification**
- DISC cues identified: D (decisive, outcome-focused), I (expressive, lifestyle-oriented), S (cautious, reassurance-seeking), C (analytical, data-driven)
- Once DISC cues appear, pacing, tone, depth, and framing must adjust immediately

---

### 2. EDUCATION PHASE
(EyeAdvisor: Process Roadmap & Credibility Building)

**Procedure Overview**
- Overview of available procedures: LASIK, PRK, SMILE, ICL
- No diagnosis, No guarantees
- Alternatives acknowledged when appropriate

**Candidacy & Safety Framing**
- General candidacy factors discussed (non-diagnostic): Eye scans, Corneal measurements, Prescription stability
- Explicit explanation that eligibility is determined at the exam; Doctor reviews scans and confirms safety
- Avoids anecdotal-only safety claims

**What to Expect**
- What happens at the exam; Who the patient will meet; What decisions are and are not made that day
- Timeline: Exam → review → procedure → recovery

**DISC-Matched Education Style**
- D/DI: concise, outcome-focused
- I/IS: conversational, lifestyle-based
- S/SC: reassuring, step-by-step
- C/CD: structured, logical, transparent

---

### 3. FINANCIAL DISCUSSION
(EyeAdvisor: Value Justification & Affordability Check)

**Required Financial Topics**
- Price range per eye; What's included
- Financing options; Monthly payment examples
- Insurance positioning: Cosmetic vs medical; Discounts if available; HSA/FSA options
- Refundable exam or reservation deposit
- Lifetime care / pledge (if offered)

**Value Framing (DISC-Specific)**
- D: ROI, efficiency, long-term payoff
- I: freedom, confidence, daily impact
- S: peace of mind, predictability
- C: transparency, cost comparison, logic

**Binary Financial Framing — REQUIRED**
- Counselor must use binary questions that both lead forward
- Examples: "Is that price range comfortable, or would monthly financing make more sense?" "Would you prefer HSA/FSA, or spreading it out monthly?"
- Penalty: Open-ended stall questions ("What do you think?") are penalized.

**Affordability Confirmation**
- Counselor confirms whether cost is: Value clarification, True affordability constraint
- Financing proactively offered if relevant
- Silent objections penalized

### 4. OBJECTION HANDLING
(EyeAdvisor: Structured Fear Handling)

**Objection Identification**
- Specific concern clearly identified: Blindness, Blood/gore, Cost/value, Insurance, Logistics/timing, Side effects/recovery

**REQUIRED: Structured 4-Step Response**
1. Label & validate the emotion
2. Explain safety assessment process (Exam, Scans, Doctor review)
3. Calibrate concern numerically ("On a scale of 1–10, where are you right now?")
4. Tie resolution to next step (Exam or consult)

**Readiness Calibration — REQUIRED**
- Numeric scale used for fear/readiness
- Example: "If the doctor can get you to a 2 or 3 after reviewing your scans, would you be ready to lock something in this Friday while it's still fresh?"

**Quality Standards:** Respectful, Credibility-based, DISC-matched, No pressure, No guarantees

**DISC Risk Flags (Penalize if present):** Rushing S/SC, Over-hyping I, Vague reassurance for C, Over-explaining to D

---

### 5. CLOSE & NEXT STEP
(EyeAdvisor: Momentum Lock & Risk Reversal)

**Required Close Elements**
- Clear next step identified
- Exam positioned as: Informational, Non-commitment, Risk-reversal explained accurately
- Urgency matched to DISC style
- Appointment scheduled or follow-up planned
- Contact information confirmed

**Binary Scheduling Questions — REQUIRED**
- "Mornings or afternoons better?" "Beginning of the week or end of the week?"
- Both options move toward booking.

**Commitment Translation**
- Verbal commitment must translate into: Date/time scheduled or Explicit follow-up action
- Failure penalized

**DISC-Aligned Closing Examples**
- D: "The exam gives you a clear yes/no."
- I: "Most patients find the exam very reassuring."
- S: "This is just to gather information—no pressure."
- C: "The exam provides the data needed to decide confidently."

### 6. CONSULTATION FLOW INTEGRITY
(EyeAdvisor Phase Discipline)

## PREFERRED PHRASING

**Opening & Discovery**

- "What matters most: convenience, clarity, or peace of mind?"

**Value**
- "Many patients tell us this changes everyday life."
- "Most people are surprised by the freedom."
- "When matched correctly, the impact is daily."

**Objections**
- "That's a very reasonable question."
- "Many patients start with that concern."
- "That's exactly what the exam is designed to clarify."

## RED FLAGS / PROHIBITED PHRASING

**Never Say**
- "It's a big decision"
- "Everyone qualifies"
- Any outcome guarantees

**Avoid**
- Dismissing cost
- Speaking beyond scope
- Anecdotal-only safety claims
