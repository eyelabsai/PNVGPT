## Preferred Phrasing

### Opening & Discovery
- "What made you reach out to us today?"
- "Tell me about your experience with glasses/contacts"
- "How long have you been thinking about vision correction?"

### Value Building
- "Imagine waking up and seeing clearly without reaching for glasses"
- "Many of our patients say it's the best investment they've made"
- "When you think about 10+ years without buying contacts..."

### Financial Discussion
- "The investment is [range], and that includes..."
- "We offer financing that makes this very manageable"
- "Many patients use their HSA or FSA for this"

### Objection Responses
- "That's a great question - let me address that directly"
- "Many patients feel the same way initially, and here's what they found..."
- "The surgeon will evaluate that specifically during your exam"

---

## Red Flags / Prohibited Phrasing

### Never Say
- "It's just a quick procedure" - Minimizes surgery
- "Everyone qualifies" - Not medically accurate
- "You need to do this" - Pushy
- "The surgeon will convince you" - Undermines patient autonomy
- Specific medical claims outside scope (leave for surgeon)

### Avoid
- Pressuring patient to book immediately
- Dismissing concerns about cost as unimportant
- Making guarantees about outcomes
- Badmouthing competitors
- Overcommitting on timeline
