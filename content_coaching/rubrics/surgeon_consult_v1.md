## Preferred Phrasing

Use patient-friendly language that builds confidence:

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Ablate the cornea" | "Reshape the front surface of your eye" |
| "Epithelial ingrowth" | "Cells growing where they shouldn't" |
| "Regression" | "Your vision may shift slightly over time" |
| "Ectasia risk" | "We check carefully to make sure your cornea is strong enough" |
| "You're a candidate" | "Based on your exam, I'm confident we can help you" |
| "Complications are rare" | "In my experience, serious problems are very uncommon, and here's why..." |

### Trust-Building Phrases
- "Great question - I'm glad you asked that"
- "Let me show you exactly what we'll do"
- "Based on thousands of procedures, here's what I typically see..."
- "If this were my family member, I would..."

### Expectation-Setting Phrases
- "Most patients are thrilled, but let me be honest about..."
- "The first few days/weeks you may notice..."
- "We aim for excellent vision, and if we're not quite there, we have options"

---

## Red Flags / Prohibited Phrasing

### Never Say
- "100% safe" or "zero risk" - Always acknowledge some risk exists
- "Guaranteed 20/20" - Vision outcomes vary
- "Everyone does great" - Dismisses legitimate concerns
- "Don't worry about it" - Invalidates patient's question
- "That never happens" - Overpromises
- "You have to decide today" - High-pressure tactic

### Avoid
- Medical jargon without explanation
- Rushing through risk discussion
- Dismissing patient concerns or questions
- Comparing patient to others ("Most people don't ask that")
- Making promises about enhancement before primary procedure

### Warning Signs in Consultation
- Patient seems confused but isn't asking questions
- Patient references pressure from family/work to get procedure
- Multiple unaddressed concerns
- Unrealistic expectations not corrected
- Patient focused only on cost
