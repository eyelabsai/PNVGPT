# SMILE FAQs

SMILE (SMall Incision Lenticule Extraction) reshapes the cornea (the clear front part of the eye) using a laser to help it better focus light. Unlike LASIK or PRK, it treats a deeper layer of the cornea and only minimally disrupts the surface. This means the procedure is extremely comfortable with a very fast visual recovery and almost no restrictions after the procedure. SMILE is sometimes called LALEX (Laser-Assisted Lenticule EXtraction).

Here is an overview of the process but it's important to know the specifics of your surgical plan may vary.

## What is SMILE eye surgery and how does it work?

SMILE (Small Incision Lenticule Extraction) is a minimally invasive laser vision correction procedure that corrects nearsightedness and astigmatism. Instead of treating the surface like LASIK or PRK, SMILE uses a different kind of laser to create a thin, lens-shaped piece of cornea (called a lenticule) which is then removed through a tiny opening. This reshapes the cornea to focus light properly to improve vision.

## Am I a good candidate for SMILE?

SMILE is ideal for people with nearsightedness (up to –10.00 D) and astigmatism (up to –3.00 D), who have stable prescriptions (this usually happens around age 18, but can be before or after) and healthy corneas. It's especially beneficial for people with mild dry eye or those in contact sports. We will evaluate your eyes carefully to determine if SMILE is right for you.

## How long does SMILE surgery take and what is recovery like?

SMILE takes about 15 minutes for both eyes, with the laser part lasting under 30 seconds. Recovery is very quick with most people noticing clearer vision by the next morning and can resume normal activities like driving or working within a day.

## Can SMILE be redone or enhanced later?

Yes! Enhancements or polishing are possible if a small prescription remains or vision changes over time. We have the knowledge and skillset to enhance SMILE in a very comfortable way and can avoid PRK in most cases.

## I’ve had SMILE before, what are my options?

Depending on your age, we have several ways to help:
- **Ages 18-40:** We absolutely can “enhance” the SMILE you’ve had before, usually by converting it to a type of LASIK. ICLs are also sometimes possible if your prescription is more than -2.50.
- **Ages 40-59:** We can adjust your SMILE with either a variation of LASIK or PRK to help you see without glasses or readers using a blended vision strategy.
- **Ages 60+:** We can correct your vision and help you be free from reading glasses or bifocals with either a Lens Replacement or Cataract Surgery if needed.

## Will I need glasses after SMILE surgery?

Most people are 20/20 or better without glasses or contacts after SMILE. However, as you age, the natural lens under the surface of the eye stiffens, a process called presbyopia or lens dysfunction, which affects near vision. This is unrelated to SMILE and happens to everyone, even those who never needed glasses before. This usually happens around the mid-40s and is why many people start to need readers or bifocals around this time. Don't worry! There are plenty of ways to keep you out of glasses at any age!

## Are there prescription or age limits for SMILE?

SMILE can treat nearsightedness up to –10.00 D and astigmatism up to –3.00 D. It's not currently approved for farsightedness or presbyopia is the United States, though clinical trials are ongoing. Patients should have a stable prescription for at least one year and no significant eye diseases like keratoconus. We offer plenty of other treatments for keratoconus!

## What are the risks and complications of SMILE?

SMILE is extremely safe. Risks generally include temporary dryness, mild glare, or in very rare circumstances residual prescription that needs to be retreated. Serious issues that threaten vision are vanishingly rare. Because the cornea is minimally affected, ongoing dry eye problems are etremely rare.

## How much does SMILE surgery cost and is it covered by insurance?

SMILE costs a few thousand dollars per eye, like LASIK. Like other vision correction surgeries, it's considered an elective procedure and not covered by insurance. We offer flexible payment plans, HSA/FSA options, and financing to make it more accessible and vision correction pays for itself after a few short years compared to the ongoing expense of contact lenses or glasses!

## How soon will I see clearly after SMILE, and when can I return to normal activities?

Most patients notice sharper vision within a few hours, and the majority are able to drive the next morning. You can return to most activities almost immediately and resume exercise or makeup the day after the procedure.

## Can SMILE correct astigmatism?

Yes! Modern SMILE technology effectively treats up to 3 diopters of astigmatism, providing smooth and stable visual outcomes.

## Does SMILE cause dry eyes or night vision issues?

Symptoms of dry eye is very rare with SMILE. Most patients experience minimal dryness that improves within a week or two. Some may notice temporary glare or halos at night initially, but these typically fade as the cornea stabilizes and the brain adapts.

## How long do SMILE results last?

SMILE provides long-term, stable results, similar to LASIK. The change to the cornea is permanent, though your eyes will still age naturally over time. Vision remains clear for decades, with very low rates of needing a touch up or enhancement. If your prescription changes later, enhancement options remain available. When the eyes naturally reach the age of needing readers or bifocals there are plenty of ways to keep you out of these too!

## Can I have SMILE if I've had prior LASIK/PRK or thin corneas?

SMILE is rarely performed after LASIK or PRK, but it's an excellent option before those procedures or for some patients that don't qualify for LASIK. For patients who've already had laser vision correction, EVO ICL, LASIK, or PRK may be better secondary options.

## Can SMILE affect cataract surgery later in life?

No. Having SMILE won't complicate future cataract surgery. When the time comes, your surgeon will use updated measurements and formulas to select the correct lens implant. SMILE does not increase the risk of cataracts or interfere with advanced IOL technology.

## How do I care for my eyes after SMILE surgery?

After the procedure, you will have drops to take for a week. There are essentially no restrictions after SMILE and you will be able to get back to normal activities the day after the procedure! We will see you one day, one week, and one month after surgery.

## What is the consultation for SMILE like?

We take all the measurements we need for any vision correction procedure at your consultation. It's important to stay out of soft contact lenses for at least five (5) days and three (3) weeks for rigid contact lenses. If you have special contact lenses, let us know when you schedule your consultation. We can operate on the same day as your consultation with proper planning.

## What is the SMILE procedure like?

We take great care to make sure there is no discomfort at any point of the procedure. We use one laser for the entire procedure and carefully remove the section of cornea. The light may go dim at several parts of the procedure. It typically takes under 15 minutes for both eyes.
