## How do I schedule a consultation?

Contact us to schedule an in-person consultation with our surgeon specialists. We charge a $50 deposit to hold your appointment, which gets applied to the cost of your procedure if you qualify and decide to move forward.

During your consultation, we will:
- Run simple tests and eye scans
- Provide a complete assessment of what's possible in your individual case
- Go over which procedure(s) you may qualify for
- Answer all your questions
- Discuss pricing and financing options

## What procedures do you offer?

We offer a comprehensive range of vision correction procedures:
- Cataract Surgery (basic and advanced technology)
- LASIK
- PRK
- SMILE
- EVO ICL (Implantable Collamer Lens)
- Refractive Lens Exchange (RLE)

## Do you accept insurance?

Yes, we gladly accept Medicare and most major insurance plans for covered procedures. Please note that insurance typically covers basic cataract surgery but considers advanced technology options and elective refractive procedures as lifestyle upgrades that are not covered. We'll review your specific insurance coverage during your consultation.
