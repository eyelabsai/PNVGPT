# Lens Options and Vision Outcomes

## How long will I see the trifocal rings?

The most recent scientific data shows that for most people (98% of people), the rings are no longer noticeable after 6 months with almost everyone no longer seeing the rings a year later. It is extremely rare that the rings don't go away or improve to a point that they are no longer bothersome or noticeable.

## What are the chances the rings don't go away / what if I don't ever get used to them?

It is extremely rare for the halos, glare, or rings, associated with multifocal IOLs to not improve or completely disappear over time as your brain adapts and learns to ignore the rings through a process called "neuroadaptation". The scientific data shows this occurs in the overwhelming majority of people by 6 months with the rest have the symptoms subside over the following 6 months. In the extremely rare event that the rings continue to bother you, it is possible to exchange the lens for a monofocal, but understand this also means reading glasses will be required again in most cases.

## Will I be able to read with this Eyhance lens?

It depends on the "target", which means where we set the lens to see the most clearly. For distance, the lens usually covers from distance to your dashboard or a plate of food. If both eyes are set this way, reading glasses are usually required. We can also use a "blended vision" strategy where one eye is targeted for distance and one eye is set to see most clearly slightly closer (but not so close you are seeing two different images and are confused). For blended vision, readers are not expected to be needed.

## Will I have 20/20 vision?

While it's not possible to guarantee an outcome, we always hope for 20/20 vision or better and will do everything we possibly can before, during, and after your procedure to get you to that point. That being said, there are some eye conditions that naturally limit vision. For example, if there is a problem with your retina (the light sensing part of the eye) or you have a history of a "lazy eye" from childhood, your vision might be limited and unable to achieve 20/20 or better but that doesn't mean we won't do absolutely everything possible to maximize your visual potential and give you hopefully the best vision you've ever had.

## Will I be 20/20 with basic (manual cataract surgery)?

For basic manual surgery, it’s best to plan full time use of glasses after surgery because we won’t be able to have the accuracy that the lasers provide.

## Will I be 20/20 after cataract surgery?

We expect your vision to be as good or slightly better than it was before you had cataracts. Some people have diseases of the cornea or retina that may limit vision but we will discuss expectations in your exact case at your consultation.

## Will I be 20/20 after EVO ICL/SMILE/PRK/LASIK/Lens Replacement?

We expect your vision to be slightly better than wearing glasses or contact lenses. For many people, this is even better than 20/20.

## Can anyone be 20/20?

You may have pre-existing eye diseases that could limit your vision (examples include needing to wear a patch as a child or retinal diseases) but these are rare and we will look for them on your exam.

## Can I change the lens after having cataract surgery?

Exchanging an IOL comes with certain risks so it’s best to choose the best lens for your eye before having cataract surgery. That being said, it’s possible to exchange an IOL in the first 6-12 months under certain circumstances.

## Will I be able to see my golf ball?

Short answer, yes. The goal of any vision correction surgery, including cataract surgery, is to optimize your vision and improve your ability to do the things you love including golf, tennis, shooting sports, reading, or simply spending time with your family. Sometimes, there are pre-existing eye diseases that may limit your vision after surgery but your doctor will perform a complete exam to uncover these and discuss vision expectations with you before proceeding.

## Will this help my double vision?

If you have double vision because of an eye alignment problem, also called "strabismus", correcting your prescription will usually not improve this. You may still need glasses with prism built into them (even if they don't have a prescription) to correct your double vision.

## Can I get by with over the counter readers afterwards?

This depends on two things. First, if we choose a multifocal lens or a blended vision strategy, you shouldn't need readers except for very rare circumstances like reading legal print. If you choose a monofocal lens and choose to optimize your vision at distance, then yes, over-the-counter readers as soon as the next day after your surgery are great. We generally recommend starting with a +2.50 but it's best to bring reading material with you to the store so you can test what reading distance and what power is most comfortable for you.

## What if I never get used to the blend?

Nearly everyone adapts to the blend if they give it enough time. To help you adapt to the blend we recommend always keeping both eyes open and never closing one eye to read or drive for example. Your brain needs time and experience to learn how to use the eyes together and get used to the blend in a process called neuroadaptation. This typically takes as little as a few days to a few months. If for some reason you cannot get used to the blend, blended vision strategies are often reversible but this involves another procedure and we like to avoid it if possible since blended vision can provide such excellent independence from glasses and contact lenses.

## My friend had Basic and doesn't need glasses anymore so why will I?

Every eye is unique! We will do everything in our power to deliver the best outcome possible, but sometimes the best outcome to match your personal goals requires using advanced technology not covered by insurance. As an example, if your friend doesn't have astigmatism and only wanted to see at one distance, it's possible basic manual cataract surgery would deliver the outcome they desire. On the other hand, if you have astigmatism that needs to be corrected or desire independence from glasses then this may require using advanced technology not covered by insurance. We will work closely with you to understand your unique eyes, your goals, and what's financially realistic while still maximizing your outcome with whatever technology we choose together.

## Why did my friend/family member/coworker/etc. get this cheaper somewhere else?

It's hard to make comparisons like this because without a full evaluation we will not know exactly what procedure you will need. I can only speak for us, but we use the most modern lasers and with surgeons who are specially trained as experts in vision correction to provide the absolute best outcomes possible.
