# ICL FAQs

## What are ICLs?

EVO ICL (Implantable Collamer® Lens) are an incredible way to correct vision and provide some of the best results possible. They are lenses, much smaller than contact lenses, that are placed under the color part of the eye (the iris) that you never need to take out or clean. You won't be able to feel them, nobody else will be able to see them, and you won't even know they're there except by being able to wake up and see clearly. They don't actually change anything about the anatomy of your eye and are completely upgradable, exchangeable, reversible, or removable.

They also may be the perfect option for those who aren't good candidates for LASIK. Visual recovery is almost immediate after surgery. ICLs can give you better vision than LASIK and are often the best choice for those that are very nearsighted. They are perfect for those with active lifestyles and those who may have some allergies or dry eyes. They will not worsen dry eye, in fact they will probably improve it since you won't be putting plastic contact lenses in every morning! They also may be perfect for those who told they may not be a good candidate for LASIK.

Here is an overview of the process and answers to general questions but it's important to know the specifics of your surgical plan may vary. Thankfully, NuVision has some of the most extensive experience in the world, having performed thousands of these procedures and publishing dozens of scientific articles about our excellent outcomes with ICLs.

## How are ICLs different than LASIK?

ICLs are unique. Unlike LASIK or PRK, which reshape the cornea (the front window of your eye) with a laser, ICLs involve adding a corrective lens. The procedure is reversible and can deliver crisp, high-definition vision with minimal recovery time. In this way, they are often considered the least invasive form of vision correction since we're not actually changing anything about the anatomy of your eyes!

## Am I a good candidate for ICL surgery? Who is a good ICL candidate?

You may be a good candidate if you are between 18 and 59 years old, have stable vision, and are nearsighted (with or without astigmatism). ICLs are especially helpful if you have an active lifestyle, a history of allergies or dry eye, or you've been told you're not a good LASIK candidates due to thin corneas or high prescriptions. We will check all of these considerations and more to ensure ICL is the best fit for your eyes.

## How long does ICL surgery take and what is recovery like?

The procedure itself takes about 5-10 minutes per eye! We will give you a few medications (no IVs!) that will make you extremely comfortable the entire time. You won't feel much at all during the procedure and it will be over before you know it! Vision often improves immediately, with most patients returning to normal activities the next day. For the first week, just take it easy with minimal lifting, straining, and avoid getting too much water (including sweat) in your eyes. Some mild glare or halos at night are normal early on, but these improve within a few months.

This is a digital rendering by Dr. Hirabayashi after his own ICL surgery of what the temporary halos look like. They are centered on the vision which means they will never interfere with central vision.

## Can the ICL be removed or changed later if needed?

Yes! One of the biggest advantages of ICLs is that they are completely reversible. The lens can be upgraded, removed, or replaced for any reason including if your prescription changes or if technology advances. That flexibility makes ICLs a safe long-term option while preserving future surgical possibilities. Because they don't change anything about your eye, you are more likely to be a candidate for whatever incredible technology is available for cataract surgery many decades later.

## Will I need reading glasses after ICL surgery?

Whether you'll need reading glasses after getting an ICL depends on your age and the vision strategy we choose. Currently, there is **NO multifocal ICL** available. The EVO ICL is designed primarily for distance vision correction.

However, we can use a **blended vision strategy** (also known as monovision) where one eye is targeted for distance and the other for closer tasks. This allows many patients to stay out of reading glasses for most daily activities.

It's important to keep in mind that as we age (typically in our 40s and beyond), the eye's natural lens loses flexibility, leading to presbyopia. While the ICL provides excellent distance vision, you may still need over-the-counter readers for very small print or prolonged close-up work unless a blended vision strategy is used.

For patients whose primary goal is to eliminate reading glasses entirely, especially those over 45, we might also discuss **Lens Replacement** (sometimes called Refractive Lens Exchange or RLE) as an alternative, which uses multifocal or extended-range lens technology that isn't available with ICLs.

The best way to know which option is right for you is a consultation!

## Are there age limits or prescription limits for ICLs?

ICL surgery is FDA-approved for adults 21–45 years old, though we are very comfortable treating patients from around 18-59 depending on eye health, personal goals, and stability of the glasses prescription. Younger patients with stable vision and older adults without cataracts are both possible candidates after an evaluation. It's typically used for moderate to high myopia (nearsightedness) from –3.00 to –20.00 D and can treat astigmatism up to 4.00 D. ICLs can also be used to help adjust the amount of prescription into a place that's treatable with LASIK or a different procedure so a combination of ICLs and LASIK may be able to treat even very high amounts of nearsightedness!

## What are the risks and complications of ICL surgery?

ICL surgery is extremely safe, but as with all eye surgeries, there are very remote risks include infection, inflammation, glare, halos, elevated eye pressure, or risk of damage to the eye. Rarely, the lens may need adjustment if fit or lens power aren't optimal. Modern EVO ICL lenses are designed to allow fluid flow through the lens, which has greatly reduced the risk of cataract formation or pressure spikes seen with older models and has made these lenses more safe and effective than ever.

## How much does ICL surgery cost and is it covered by insurance?

ICL surgery costs a few thousand dollars per eye. It's usually not covered by insurance. However, we offer financing options, FSA/HSA eligibility, and 0% payment plans. Compared to the long-term cost of glasses or contacts, many view it as a lifetime investment in clear vision that pays for itself in a few short years.

## How soon will I see clearly after ICL surgery, and when can I return to normal activities?

Many patients notice dramatic vision improvement within hours, and most return to work or normal routines the next day. Eye drops are used for about a week, and swimming or makeup should be avoided for a few days. Heavy exercise can usually resume within a week, as advised by your doctor.

On a personal note, Dr. Hirabayashi drove his wife home after being her ICL surgeon and she was easily reading street signs and amazed at the immediate improvement in vision on a couple hours later!

## Can I have ICL surgery if I have astigmatism or very high myopia?

Yes! EVO Toric ICL can correct both myopia and astigmatism in one procedure. It's especially effective for patients with high prescriptions (beyond the range of LASIK or PRK). The ICL's optical quality remains excellent even in extreme cases, providing sharp, stable vision where laser options may not be safe or provide as clear of vision. As we mentioned, there are even times where we can combine ICLs and LASIK to treat even very high amounts of nearsightedness!

## Does ICL surgery cause dry eyes or night vision issues?

ICL surgery does not involve reshaping the cornea, so it doesn't disrupt corneal nerves or tear production. This means ICLs will not affect dry eye symptoms. Some patients may experience temporary halos or glare at night, but these usually fade within the first few weeks to months as the eyes and brain adapt.

## How does ICL compare in long-term stability versus laser vision correction?

ICLs tend to offer very stable vision over time. The plan is to leave the ICLs in place until you naturally need cataract surgery many decades later. The ICL's reversibility and preservation of corneal structure make it an especially appealing choice for younger patients and those with high prescriptions because they allow a lot of flexibility later in life if adjustments are needed due to the rare event of a change in prescription.

## Can I get ICLs if I've had prior LASIK/PRK or have thin corneas?

In many cases, yes! ICL can be used to fine-tune vision after prior refractive surgery or in patients with thin or irregular corneas where additional laser correction is unsafe. Your eye's anatomy and residual prescription will determine if ICLs are the best fit for your eyes. ICLs are particularly beneficial when corneal thickness limits other options.

## Can ICLs prevent cataracts or affect future cataract surgery?

ICLs do not prevent cataracts because cataracts develop naturally with age in the eye's natural lens. However, having an ICL doesn't affect future cataract surgery. When the time comes, the ICL is simply removed during the cataract procedure, and a new intraocular lens (IOL) is placed, just like standard cataract surgery! ICLs will not limit your options for what technology is possible in the future.

## How do I care for my eyes after ICL surgery?

After ICL surgery, you'll use prescription eye drops for a week to prevent infection and inflammation. Avoid rubbing your eyes, swimming, or wearing eye makeup for several days. Follow-up visits will ensure that everything looks good. Most people return to full activity quickly with clearer, more comfortable vision than they've ever experienced!

## How do I prepare for my ICL consultation?

We take all the measurements we need for any vision correction procedure at your consultation. It's important to stay out of soft contact lenses for at least five (5) days and three (3) weeks for rigid contact lenses. If you have special contact lenses, let us know when you schedule your consultation. We can operate on the same day as your consultation with proper planning.

## What is ICL surgery like?

We take great care to make sure there is no discomfort at any point of the procedure. We make two very small openings in the cornea (the clear part at the front of the eye), fold the ICL, and insert it behind the iris and in front of your natural lens. Both eyes are completed on the same day and the procedure itself usually takes about 10 minutes.
