# Post-Operative Care and Follow-Ups

## How long are the follow ups?

We (or the eye doctor that you normally work with) will see you at one day, one week, and one or two months after the procedures. You then resume normal eye exams every year. The appointments usually last under 30 minutes as we collect the scans we need, check your vision, and make sure you're healing as expected.

## Will I get charged for post ops?

Your post ops, either with us or your usual eye doctor, are covered as part of the procedure.

## Will my eye doctor charge me for post ops?

Yes, but this is included in the cost of your surgery.

## Can I get my yearly eye exams with you?

Cataract and vision correction surgery is all we do! We are not primary eye doctors so encourage you to continue your routine eye exams with the optometrist you normally see. If you don't have a primary eye doctor, we will find one for you based on convenience and where you live!
