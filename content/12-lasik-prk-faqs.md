# LASIK and PRK FAQs

LASIK (Laser in-situ Keratomileusis) and PRK (Photorefractive Keratectomy) use a laser to reshape the cornea (the clear, front part of the eye) so it can better focus light onto the retina. The method they accomplish this differs between them. PRK applies the laser through all the frontmost layers of the cornea while LASIK first creates a window so healing is extra fast and easy.

Here is an overview of the process but it's important to know the specifics of your surgical plan may vary.

## What is LASIK and how does it differ from PRK?

Both LASIK and PRK very precisely reshape the cornea using a laser to correct vision, but the main difference is how the surface of the eye is treated.

In LASIK, a window is created on the cornea and then replaced after laser treatment leading to a recovery that only takes hours. In PRK, the laser treats through the surface layer (epithelium) which regrows naturally over a few days. LASIK offers quicker comfort and clarity but PRK can can sometimes be used for people with certain eye diseases or anatomy.

## Am I a good candidate for LASIK or PRK?

Good candidates are typically around 18 years or older, with stable prescriptions and healthy eyes. LASIK requires your cornea be thick, healthy, and clear. PRK can even be used to improve vision in certain diseases like keratoconus. Both can correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. A full eye exam including corneal scans determines eligibility and which procedure is best suited for your eyes.

## How long does LASIK or PRK surgery take and what is recovery like?

Both procedures take about 10–15 minutes for both eyes. LASIK patients often notice improved vision within hours and can resume normal activities within a day or two. PRK recovery takes a weekend or so while the surface layer to heals but the final vision result is just as sharp. PRK patients use protective contact lenses and medicated drops during healing to stay comfortable. For LASIK, you'll just need an antibiotic drop 4 times a day for a week!

## Can LASIK or PRK be redone or enhanced later?

Yes! Enhancements are sometimes performed to touch up your outcome or if vision changes over time. LASIK or PRK can be used to fine-tune vision. We will determine timing and method based on corneal thickness, healing response, and visual stability.

## Preparation

We take all the measurements we need for any vision correction procedure at your consultation. It's important to stay out of soft contact lenses for at least five (5) days and three (3) weeks for rigid contact lenses. If you have special contact lenses, let us know when you schedule your consultation. We can operate on the same day as your consultation with proper planning.

## Will I need glasses after LASIK or PRK?

Most patients achieve 20/20 or better distance vision and no longer rely on glasses or contacts. However, people naturally develop the need for reading glasses around their mid-40s in a condition called presbyopia or lens dysfunction. Don't worry, there are plenty of ways to keep you out of readers too if you're in your 40s and even if you've had LASIK before there's usually ways to treat you again and keep you out of those readers!

## Are there age or prescription limits for LASIK or PRK?

Candidates are usually over 18 years old, with prescriptions that have been stable for at least one year. LASIK can correct a large amount of nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism but if you're prescription is very high, we may even combine technologies in order to treat your entire prescription. For example, combining EVO ICL with LASIK can treat extremely high amounts of nearsightedness!

## What are the risks and side effects of LASIK or PRK?

Both procedures are very safe, but possible side effects include temporary dry eyes, temporary glare or halos, or very rarely the need to re-treat in order to optimize vision. Serious complications like infection or irregular healing are vanishingly rare when performed by an experienced team. PRK can cause mild discomfort during surface healing, while LASIK recovery is virtually painless.

## How much does LASIK or PRK cost and is it covered by insurance?

LASIK is a few thousand dollars per eye because these are considered elective procedures and insurance doesn't usually cover them. But, HSA/FSA funds or financing plans often apply! Many patients see it as a one-time investment that replaces years of glasses, contacts, and lens fittings. Vision correction pays for itself in a few short years compared to the ongoing expense of glasses or contact lenses.

## How soon will I see clearly after LASIK or PRK?

With LASIK, vision improves within 24 hours! Most people wake up the next morning being able to see clearly! PRK usually takes a weekend for crisp vision but both achieve excellent long-term outcomes once fully healed.

## Can LASIK or PRK treat astigmatism?

Yes! Both LASIK and PRK are extremely effective at correcting astigmatism. The laser very precisely reshapes the cornea to a more symmetrical curve, eliminating distortion or blur. There are different versions of LASIK and we will choose the best fit for your eyes. For example, modern topography-guided lasers treat even irregular astigmatism, offering sharper and more customized vision than ever before.

## Does LASIK or PRK cause dry eyes or night vision problems?

Dry eye is actually most commonly caused by contact lenses or allergies! It is a result of the inadequate production of tears that cover the cornea. LASIK doesn't impact tear production. LASIK can cause temporary symptoms of dryness for the first few weeks after surgery, but they typically resolve as the cornea heals. Night glare or halos may appear early on but improve over time. Using preservative-free artificial tears and following drop schedules helps speed recovery and resolution of both symptoms!

## How long do LASIK and PRK results last?

The corneal reshaping from LASIK or PRK is permanent. However, natural aging changes, like presbyopia (AKA lens dysfunction) or cataracts, can still affect vision later in life (usually starting in the mid to late 40s). Many patients enjoy decades of clear vision before any additional treatment is needed. Enhancements are occasionally performed if the prescription shifts slightly with age and there are plenty of ways we cant either get you out of or keep you out of reading glasses!

## Can I have LASIK or PRK if I've had prior eye surgery or thin corneas?

That depends on the type of surgery and corneal measurements. Patients with thin corneas or prior procedures (like RK or LASIK) may still qualify for PRK or other surface laser options. Some may benefit more from EVO ICL or lens-based correction instead. We will perform a detailed evaluation to ensure the best fit is chosen for your eyes that will result in the best vision possible!

## Can LASIK or PRK affect cataract surgery in the future?

Future cataract surgery is expected after LASIK or PRK since we all will eventually need cataract surgery. LASIK and PRK do not increase cataract risk and do not generally interfere with modern lens technologies used in cataract surgery.

## How do I care for my eyes after LASIK or PRK?

After surgery, you'll use antibiotic drops for about a week and avoid rubbing your eyes. Most people resume normal routines within 24 hours after LASIK and 2-3 days after PRK. Avoid swimming, eye makeup, or dirty/dusty environments for the first week. We, or the eye doctor that you normally see, will check on your eyes 1 day, 1 week, and 1-2 months after the procedure.

## What is LASIK surgery like?

We take great care to make sure there is no discomfort at any point of the procedure. You won't feel anything the entire time and it will be over before you know it. Both LASIK and PRK take about 15 minutes for both eyes!
