# Surgery Day and Procedure Questions

## How do I get started / What's the first step?

The first step is an in-person consultation with our surgeon specialists. During this consultation, we will run some simple tests and eye scans to give you a complete assessment of what's possible in your individual case. After we complete these tests, we will go over which procedure(s) you may qualify for and answer any questions you may have.

We charge a $50 deposit to hold your appointment with the surgeon specialists, which gets applied to the cost of your procedure if you qualify and decide to move forward.

## Does it hurt?

You should be very comfortable during the procedure. Through our careful combination of eye drops, oral medication, and IV medication, you should be extremely comfortable. If you are feeling any sensation of pressure or stinging, you will be awake enough to let us know you are uncomfortable and we will give you more anesthesia.

We take great care to make sure you are extremely comfortable throughout the entire procedure. This may involve a combination of numbing eye drops, oral medications, or IV medications.

## What type of anesthesia do you use?

The type of anesthesia we use depends on the type of procedure. For cataract surgery, an anesthesiologist uses a combination of propofol and versed so the level of sedation should be very similar to a colonoscopy. For lens replacement, we use versed and fentanyl. For ICLs no IV is necessary! We use oral valium and something called an MKO melt. This dissolvable medicine has ketamine and an anti-nausea agent in it. For LASIK, SMILE, and PRK we use oral valium. Rest assured, you will be very comfortable the entire time but none of our procedures require you to be fully "under" anesthesia. You are always awake enough that we can communicate. That means we can provide instructions like "please look at this light" and you can also let us know if you're uncomfortable so we can provide you with more anesthesia.

## Who will be my surgeon?

Your surgeon will be one of our specialty-trained, world-class experts who underwent additional training to perform thousands of these procedures in order to master them. Currently, our surgeons are Greg Parkhurst, Lauren Libfraind, Matt Hirabayashi, and Travis Parker.

## How long does the surgery take?

The procedure takes under 10 minutes per eye, for most people it's over before they even realize it started!

## How long will I be here on surgery day?

While all of these procedures are very quick (typically 5-10 minutes per eye), you will still need to check in, get comfortable, and allow for relaxing medications to take effect. Immediately after the procedure, you will need time for the relaxing medications to wear off before a driver takes you home. Because of the check-in and check-out steps, the whole day usually takes 2-3 hours.

## Do I need a driver?

Because we use medications that will help you to relax and maximize your comfort during the procedure, you will not be able to operate heavy machinery after your procedure (this includes driving). It's important to have a close friend or family member that can drive you to and from your surgery.

## Can I eat after my surgery?

Yes, you can eat immediately after any procedure and in fact, we often provide you with a snack as the anesthesia is wearing off. We encourage you to enjoy a nice meal after your procedure and then take a nap.

## Will I get an anesthesia bill?

For cataract surgery, you will receive a separate bill from anesthesia to your insurance. It's not possible to provide an exact number for what this will be as they are a third party. We don't have the ability to see their pricing and pricing depends on several factors like medications required and time of anesthesia.

## Do I need to do anything before surgery to prep?

The most important thing is to get a good night sleep before your procedure! Don't wear your contact lenses to your procedure and take all medications like you normally would in the morning with a small sip of water. We recommend wearing warm, comfortable clothes to your procedure (you won't need to change) because it's usually chilly in the procedure rooms.

## What medicines do I need to stop taking before surgery?

None! Continue all medication as you normally would and take all medications with a small sip of water as normal the morning of your procedure.

## Can I do basic for now and switch to laser later on?

Cataract surgery cannot be repeated because the cataract can never come back. This means you should think very carefully about which lens best fits your needs. While it is possible to exchange a lens within 6-12 months after your surgery, there are risks associated with this and it requires an additional expense. Similarly, LASIK can technically be performed after but this also comes with an additional cost and it would only correct for one vision distance, near or far.

## Can I do basic and then have LASIK if I want to later?

This is possible, but keep in mind it is an additional procedure with an additional cost. LASIK is also not able to simulate certain IOL technologies such as multifocal or extended range lenses so it's very important to carefully think about your goals, desires, and what is realistic for you before deciding on a plan for surgery.

## Can I do the premium lens without laser surgery?

[ANSWER NEEDED]

## Why do you charge before I've even had my surgery?

We want your surgery day to be as comfortable, stress-free, and relaxed as possible so we handle all the logistics ahead of time. This way, your surgery is focused on a great experience instead of working out details.

## If I cancel will I get a refund?

Yes, if you cancel your surgery we will provide a refund for anything you have paid towards the surgery. Some of our office visits include charges that are not refundable because they include the planning stages of the surgery.

## How many surgeries do you do a year?

We perform several thousand cataract surgeries and several thousand vision correction procedures (EVO ICL, LASIK, SMILE, and PRK). Vision correction is our specialty and ALL we do!

## Are your surgeries done here or do I need to go to a separate facility?

[ANSWER NEEDED]

## What surgeon is the best?

All of our surgeons have undergone special training where they performed thousands of these procedures to truly master them. This means they all have a very similar skillset and technically perform in the same way.

## Has anyone ever gone blind?

Blindness is so exceedingly rare after cataract surgery or vision correction surgery that it's hard to even quantify.

## Why do I hear bad press about LASIK on the news?

You may hear about it in news stories as it is so unusual that it's normally the result of a long cascade of errors. Most of the bad press you hear about vision correction or cataract surgery is similar. They're newsworthy because they're rare. They're also the result of a long chain of mistakes that may include not choosing the best procedure for each unique eye. Your eyes are not one size fits all which is why we do everything in our power to deliver the best, and safest, outcome.
