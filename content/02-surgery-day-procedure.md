# Surgery Day and Procedure Questions

## Does it hurt?

You should be very comfortable during the procedure. Through our careful combination of eye drops, oral medication, and IV medication, you should be extremely comfortable. If you are feeling any sensation of pressure or stinging, you will be awake enough to let us know you are uncomfortable and we will give you more anesthesia.

## What type of anesthesia do you use?

For cataract surgery, our anesthesiologist uses a combination of medications like propofol and versed to keep you very comfortable throughout the procedure. For refractive surgery (EVO ICL, LASIK, PRK, SMILE, Lens Replacement), we use medications like valium to keep you comfortable throughout the entire procedure.

## How long does the surgery take?

For cataract surgery, the procedure itself typically takes about 10-15 minutes per eye. For LASIK or PRK, the laser treatment takes less than a minute per eye, though you'll be in the procedure room for about 15-20 minutes total. The actual laser reshaping of your cornea only takes seconds!
