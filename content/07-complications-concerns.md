# Complications and Concerns

## What if my cataracts come back?

A cataract happens when the lens behind the iris (color part of the eye) becomes cloudy. This most commonly happens normally with age. Cataract surgery involves replacing this cloudy lens with a brand new clear lens in the same capsule (or bag) that the old lens was in. Because the old, cloudy lens is gone, the cataract can NEVER come back! About 50% of the time, the capsule (or bag) that the lens is placed in can become cloudy. While the symptoms may be similar to those of a cataract, that is not what's happening, and this condition called PCO, posterior capsular opacification can be corrected in 20 seconds using a painless laser in the office.

## What's the enhancement rate?

While modern equations are extremely accurate, no amount of AI, algorithms, or advanced measurement can ever account for the element of human healing. This means about 3 percent of the time, an additional step may be needed but it's covered as part of your lifetime pledge.

## Will my eyes be dry afterwards?

After any procedure, it's normal to feel a little itchiness or scratchiness/sand feeling. This typically lasts only a day or two and gets better every day. This can last a little longer for PRK. This should be minimal for ICLs. It's important to remember that these procedures, even LASIK, do NOT cause "dry eye." The dry eye symptoms improve over the first few days.

## What happens if I get an infection?

An eye infection after cataract surgery or vision correction is vanishingly rare. We're talking 1 in 10s of thousands. This number is so low because of all the precautions we take including using antibiotics during the procedure and providing you with antibiotics to use afterwards. The best way to prevent an infection is to follow the instructions and use your antibiotic drop. In the extremely rare event that an infection develops, the symptoms will be significantly worsening vision and pain. If you experience those symptoms, call us ASAP and we will make sure you get the treatment you need.

## If I'm a glaucoma suspect can I still have surgery?

[ANSWER NEEDED]

## What happens if I never get my cataracts removed?

If left untreated, cataracts will only continue to worsen, leading to increasing blur, glare, and potential vision loss. Advanced cataracts can make daily activities unsafe, especially driving, and may become more risky to remove later. Timely surgery restores both clarity and confidence in everyday tasks!

## Will my eyelids get droopy?

It's very unlikely that these procedures cause your eyelids to become droopy but there is a rare possibility of worsening pre-existing droopiness (also called "ptosis"). This is why we suggest if you're considering eyelid surgery to have cataract surgery first, just in case the instrument we use to keep your eyelids open and eyelashes out of the way doesn't inadvertently worsen the droopiness.

## Can my flap move?

After LASIK, the window through which we treat to re-shape the cornea is placed back. After about 60 seconds, the window is well adhered to the rest of the cornea again. This only strengthens over time. To cause a problem, movement, or dislocation requires a very specific amount of force in a very precise location and is extremely rare.
