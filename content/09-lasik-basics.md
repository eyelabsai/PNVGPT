# LASIK Basics

## What is LASIK?

LASIK is a painless, quick laser vision correction procedure where we use an extremely precise laser to reshape the front surface of the eye (the cornea) to better focus the light. Treatment is customized to each individual eye and frequently patients say they see better after LASIK than they ever did with glasses or contacts. Relaxing medication is given before surgery to help you feel comfortable. The surgery only takes 10 short minutes! Recovery is fast; you'll be back to your normal routine the next day and will be using eye drops for only 1 week after surgery. Visual outcomes are excellent, and our patients often comment that they wish they had done it sooner! Did you know LASIK can also correct your astigmatism?

## How does LASIK work?

During LASIK, your surgeon creates a thin window in your cornea, then uses an excimer laser to precisely reshape the underlying corneal tissue. The laser removes microscopic amounts of tissue to correct how light enters your eye. After reshaping, the window is repositioned and heals naturally without stitches.

## Am I a good candidate for LASIK?

Good LASIK candidates have stable vision for at least a year (this usually happens around age 18, but can be before or after), have healthy eyes free from diseases, and have an adequate corneal thickness. During your consultation, we'll perform comprehensive testing to determine if LASIK is right for you.

## What is the recovery time for LASIK?

Recovery is fast; you'll be back to your normal routine the next day and will be using eye drops for only 1 week after surgery. Most patients notice improved vision within 24 hours. Complete healing takes several weeks, but most patients experience minimal downtime. We'll provide detailed post-operative instructions and schedule follow-up visits to monitor your progress.

## Is LASIK painful?

LASIK feels NO pain during the procedure. Through a combination of numbing eye drops and relaxing medications, you won't feel anything. Some patients may feel slight pressure during the treatment, but the procedure itself is not painful. After surgery, you might experience mild discomfort, dryness, or a scratchy sensation for a few hours, but this typically resolves quickly.

## What is SMILE and how is it different from LASIK?

Not to get too technical, but SMILE (Small Incision Lenticule Extraction) employs a single laser to reshape the cornea by creating what's called a "lenticule" that contains the exact prescription of your eye causing you to need glasses and contacts. This microscopic lenticule is then removed by a surgeon specialist, effectively correcting the vision. LASIK has a similar goal and effect but is executed another way with the use of 2 lasers - one to provide access to a layer in the cornea that can be reshaped, and the other to do the reshaping. Recovery time is similar.

## What is EVO ICL?

EVO ICL (Implantable Collamer Lens) is an excellent vision correction option, especially for those who don't qualify for LASIK. It takes only minutes to complete this totally painless procedure, and patients can typically return to work or school the next day.

Key advantages of EVO include:
- Upgradable in the unlikely event that things change considerably down the line
- Reversible in the extremely unlikely event a person didn't like something about it and wanted to go back
- Superior night vision compared to other procedures
- Does not aggravate any pre-existing dry eye
- Quick and painless procedure

Total cost varies by prescription and procedure needed, but generally costs about $2,500-3,000 per eye for laser treatments or $150 per month when financed.

## What is Lens Replacement?

Lens Replacement (sometimes called Refractive Lens Exchange or RLE) is a procedure where the natural lens under the surface of the eye is replaced with a high-tech lens implant. This is particularly beneficial for people in their 40s and 50s experiencing presbyopia (difficulty seeing up close).

The natural lens we are born with starts to age and dysfunction in our 40s and 50s. This is what causes our prescription to change in that age range, especially for seeing up close. Once this dysfunctional lens is replaced with a hi-tech lens implant by our surgeon, the prescription doesn't change anymore - it's permanent! Lens Replacement prevents cataracts from ever forming and eliminates the need for future cataract surgery.

For Lens Replacement, the total cost varies by prescription and generally costs about $6,500 per eye or $350 per month when financed. We will go over this in a lot more detail during an in-person consultation with our surgeon specialists to answer all the questions you may have.

## Can EVO or Lens Replacement help with keratoconus?

Great question! A lot of people wonder about this! In short, we've been able to help hundreds of people with keratoconus using specific procedures. We will go over this in a lot more detail during an in-person consultation with our surgeon specialists to answer any questions you may have and to see if you qualify.
