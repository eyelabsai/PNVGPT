# LASIK Basics

## What is LASIK?

LASIK (Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis) is a popular refractive surgery procedure that uses a laser to reshape the cornea and correct vision problems. It can treat nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), and astigmatism. The procedure is quick, typically taking about 10-15 minutes per eye, and most patients experience significant vision improvement within 24 hours.

## How does LASIK work?

During LASIK, your surgeon creates a thin flap in your cornea, then uses an excimer laser to precisely reshape the underlying corneal tissue. The laser removes microscopic amounts of tissue to correct how light enters your eye. After reshaping, the flap is repositioned and heals naturally without stitches.

## Am I a good candidate for LASIK?

Good LASIK candidates are typically over 18 years old with stable vision for at least a year, have healthy eyes free from diseases, and have an adequate corneal thickness. During your consultation, we'll perform comprehensive testing to determine if LASIK is right for you.

## What is the recovery time for LASIK?

Most patients notice improved vision within 24 hours after LASIK. You can typically return to work and normal activities within 1-2 days. Complete healing takes several weeks, but most patients experience minimal downtime. We'll provide detailed post-operative instructions and schedule follow-up visits to monitor your progress.

## Is LASIK painful?

Most patients report feeling little to no pain during LASIK. We use numbing eye drops to keep you comfortable throughout the procedure. Some patients may feel slight pressure during the treatment, but the procedure itself is not painful. After surgery, you might experience mild discomfort, dryness, or a scratchy sensation for a few hours, but this typically resolves quickly.
