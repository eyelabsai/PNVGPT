# LASIK Basics

## What is LASIK?

LASIK (Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis) is a popular refractive surgery procedure that uses a laser to reshape the cornea and correct vision problems. It can treat nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), and astigmatism. The procedure is quick, typically taking about 10-15 minutes per eye, and most patients experience significant vision improvement within 24 hours.

## How does LASIK work?

During LASIK, your surgeon creates a thin flap in your cornea, then uses an excimer laser to precisely reshape the underlying corneal tissue. The laser removes microscopic amounts of tissue to correct how light enters your eye. After reshaping, the flap is repositioned and heals naturally without stitches.

## Am I a good candidate for LASIK?

Good LASIK candidates are typically over 18 years old with stable vision for at least a year, have healthy eyes free from diseases, and have an adequate corneal thickness. During your consultation, we'll perform comprehensive testing to determine if LASIK is right for you.

## What is the recovery time for LASIK?

Most patients notice improved vision within 24 hours after LASIK. You can typically return to work and normal activities within 1-2 days. Complete healing takes several weeks, but most patients experience minimal downtime. We'll provide detailed post-operative instructions and schedule follow-up visits to monitor your progress.

## Is LASIK painful?

Most patients report feeling little to no pain during LASIK. We use numbing eye drops to keep you comfortable throughout the procedure. Some patients may feel slight pressure during the treatment, but the procedure itself is not painful. After surgery, you might experience mild discomfort, dryness, or a scratchy sensation for a few hours, but this typically resolves quickly.

## What is SMILE and how is it different from LASIK?

Not to get too technical, but SMILE (Small Incision Lenticule Extraction) employs a single laser to reshape the cornea by creating what's called a "lenticule" that contains the exact prescription of your eye causing you to need glasses and contacts. This microscopic lenticule is then removed by a surgeon specialist, effectively correcting the vision. LASIK has a similar goal and effect but is executed another way with the use of 2 lasers - one to provide access to a layer in the cornea that can be reshaped, and the other to do the reshaping. Recovery time is similar.

## What is EVO ICL?

EVO ICL (Implantable Collamer Lens) is an excellent vision correction option, especially for those who don't qualify for LASIK. It takes only minutes to complete this totally painless procedure, and patients can typically return to work or school the next day.

Key advantages of EVO include:
- Upgradable in the unlikely event that things change considerably down the line
- Reversible in the extremely unlikely event a person didn't like something about it and wanted to go back
- Superior night vision compared to other procedures
- Does not aggravate any pre-existing dry eye
- Quick and painless procedure

Total cost varies by prescription and procedure needed, but generally costs about $2,500-3,000 per eye for laser treatments or $150 per month when financed.

## What is Refractive Lens Exchange (RLE)?

Refractive Lens Exchange is a procedure where the natural lens inside your eye is replaced with a high-tech lens implant. This is particularly beneficial for people in their 40s and 50s experiencing presbyopia (difficulty seeing up close).

The inside natural lens we are born with starts to age and dysfunction in our 40s and 50s. This is what causes our prescription to change in that age range, especially for seeing up close. Once this dysfunctional lens is replaced with a hi-tech lens implant by our surgeon, the prescription doesn't change anymore - it's permanent!

For RLE, the total cost varies by prescription and generally costs about $6,500 per eye or $350 per month when financed. We will go over this in a lot more detail during an in-person consultation with our surgeon specialists to answer all the questions you may have.

## Can EVO or RLE help with keratoconus?

Great question! A lot of people wonder about this! In short, we've been able to help hundreds of people with keratoconus using specific procedures. We will go over this in a lot more detail during an in-person consultation with our surgeon specialists to answer any questions you may have and to see if you qualify.
