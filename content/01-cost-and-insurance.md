# Cost and Insurance Questions

## Why is this so much?

Insurance covers the cost to remove the cataract and place a new lens (called an intraocular lens, or IOL) that doesn't have any special technology. Special technology includes things that would help you have some freedom from glasses such as astigmatism correction (called toric IOLs) or multifocal or EDOF IOLs that provide clear vision at multiple distances. Insurance doesn't cover the cost of the laser since the laser is used to help correct astigmatism.

## Why doesn't my insurance cover this?

Insurance only covers the cost of removing the cataract and placing a new lens (called an intraocular lens, or IOL) that doesn't have any special technology. Special technology includes things that would help you have some freedom from glasses such as astigmatism correction (called toric IOLs) or multifocal or EDOF IOLs that provide clear vision at multiple distances. Insurance doesn't cover the cost of the laser since the laser is used to help correct astigmatism. Unfortunately insurance doesn't consider these lifestyle upgrades "medically necessary", similar to aesthetics procedures. Insurance doesn't cover any technology that would provide some independence from glasses or contact lenses.

## Is this the typical price of this surgery?

Basic manual cataract surgery is usually covered by insurance but unfortunately insurance considers any additional technology to be more like a "cosmetic procedure". Prices for these additional options that provide lifestyle improvements can vary between clinics and depend on several factors including how much the lasers and lenses with advanced technology cost.
