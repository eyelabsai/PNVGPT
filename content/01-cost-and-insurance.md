# Cost and Insurance Questions

## Why is this so much?

Insurance covers the cost to remove the cataract and place a new lens (called an intraocular lens, or IOL) that doesn't have any special technology. Special technology includes things that would help you have some freedom from glasses such as astigmatism correction (called toric IOLs) or multifocal or EDOF IOLs that provide clear vision at multiple distances. Insurance doesn't cover the cost of the laser since the laser is used to help correct astigmatism.

For age-related cataract surgery with advanced technology, the total cost varies by prescription and procedure needed, but generally costs about $2,500-3,000 per eye or $150 per month when financed. For refractive lens exchange (RLE), which is performed electively before a true cataract diagnosis or for presbyopia treatment, costs are generally about $3,500-4,500 per eye or $250 per month when financed. Most people divert what they spend on glasses and contacts toward this, and depending on the type of glasses they need, the procedures often pay for themselves within a few years.

## Why doesn't my insurance cover this?

Insurance only covers the cost of removing the cataract and placing a new lens (called an intraocular lens, or IOL) that doesn't have any special technology. Special technology includes things that would help you have some freedom from glasses such as astigmatism correction (called toric IOLs) or multifocal or EDOF IOLs that provide clear vision at multiple distances. Insurance doesn't cover the cost of the laser since the laser is used to help correct astigmatism. Unfortunately insurance doesn't consider these lifestyle upgrades "medically necessary", similar to aesthetics procedures. Insurance doesn't cover any technology that would provide some independence from glasses or contact lenses.

Insurance companies unfortunately consider elective procedures like refractive lens exchange elective and do not cover them. While the procedure is not cheap, most people divert what they spend on glasses and contacts toward this. Depending on how much they normally spend, it often pays for itself within a few years.

## Is this the typical price of this surgery?

Basic manual cataract surgery is usually covered by insurance but unfortunately insurance considers any additional technology to be more like a "cosmetic procedure". Prices for these additional options that provide lifestyle improvements can vary between clinics and depend on several factors including how much the lasers and lenses with advanced technology cost.

We charge a $50 deposit to hold your appointment with the surgeon specialists, which gets applied to the cost of your procedure if you qualify and decide to move forward. Procedures range from a few thousand per eye and we offer financing to those who qualify.

Yes, we gladly accept Medicare. For advanced technology options like reading vision lenses, there are also charges on top of what Medicare pays. Costs vary by needs, so we encourage you to come in for a consultation with our surgeons, at which time we can let you know if you qualify and what all costs would be.
