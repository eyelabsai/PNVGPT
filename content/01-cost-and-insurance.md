# Cost and Insurance Questions

## Why is this so much?

Insurance covers the cost to remove the cataract and place a new lens (called an intraocular lens, or IOL) that doesn't have any special technology. Special technology includes things that would help you have some freedom from glasses such as astigmatism correction (called toric IOLs) or multifocal or EDOF IOLs that provide clear vision at multiple distances. Insurance doesn't cover the cost of the laser since the laser is used to help correct astigmatism.

For age-related cataract surgery with advanced technology, the total cost varies by prescription and procedure needed, but generally costs about $2,500-3,000 per eye or $150 per month when financed. For Lens Replacement (sometimes called Refractive Lens Exchange or RLE), which is performed electively before a true cataract diagnosis or for presbyopia treatment, costs are generally about $3,500-4,500 per eye or $250 per month when financed. Most people divert what they spend on glasses and contacts toward this, and depending on the type of glasses they need, the procedures often pay for themselves within a few years.

## Why doesn't my insurance cover this?

Insurance only covers the cost of removing the cataract and placing a new lens (called an intraocular lens, or IOL) that doesn't have any special technology. Special technology includes things that would help you have some freedom from glasses such as astigmatism correction (called toric IOLs) or multifocal or EDOF IOLs that provide clear vision at multiple distances. Insurance doesn't cover the cost of the laser since the laser is used to help correct astigmatism. Insurance considers these lifestyle upgrades elective and does not cover them. Insurance considers elective procedures like Lens Replacement elective and does not cover them. While the procedure is not cheap, most people divert what they spend on glasses and contacts toward this. Depending on how much they normally spend, it often pays for itself within a few years.

## Is this the typical price of this surgery?

Yes, this is the typical price for us. It's hard to say what the "typical price" of these procedures are. Our pricing reflects both the raw costs of materials (the lenses, the price of firing the laser) and the expertise of our surgeons who have dedicated extra time in training to perform thousands of these procedures in order to master them.

Basic manual cataract surgery is usually covered by insurance but unfortunately insurance considers any additional technology to be more like a "cosmetic procedure". Prices for these additional options that provide lifestyle improvements can vary between clinics and depend on several factors including how much the lasers and lenses with advanced technology cost and sometimes how much correction you need.

## Why is the price higher than competitors?

We are committed to such a high level of excellence, for example offering programs like lifetime pledge. We also use the most up-to-date technology and lasers available and our surgeons are specialty trained with some of the most experience in the country performing these procedures. To our knowledge, nobody in this area performs any of these procedures using our techniques.

## Is there a discount if I pay in full?

We expect everyone to pay in full, but we do provide a discount if you pay in cash.

## Can you price match?

We don't offer price matching because we are committed to such a high level of excellence, for example offering programs like lifetime pledge. We also use the most up-to-date technology and lasers available and our surgeons are specialty trained with some of the most experience in the country performing these procedures. To our knowledge, no one in our area performs these procedures the same way that we do so there is no way to even price match them.

## Will I have the same outcome as my friend, they didn't pay anything?

Every eye is unique! We will do everything in our power to deliver the best outcome possible, but sometimes the best outcome to match your personal goals requires using advanced technology not covered by insurance. As an example, if your friend doesn't have astigmatism and only wanted to see at one distance, it's possible basic manual cataract surgery would deliver the outcome they desire. On the other hand, if you have astigmatism that needs to be corrected or desire independence from glasses then this may require using advanced technology not covered by insurance. We will work closely with you to understand your unique eyes, your goals, and what's financially realistic while still maximizing your outcome with whatever technology we choose together.

## How much does laser cataract surgery cost?

Laser cataract surgery costs a few thousand dollars depending on your insurance benefits and what type of lens you choose.

## Can I do laser without astigmatism correction?

Almost everyone has even small amounts of astigmatism that the laser can correct. It's been shown in the scientific literature that correcting even these small amounts of astigmatism improve your outcome so correcting your astigmatism is a very important part of using the laser.

## Is there any government assistance to help with the cost?

Unfortunately, insurance and government programs consider the use of advanced technology like lenses for cataract surgery that correct astigmatism or provide independence from glasses OR any vision correction procedure to be elective and does not cover them. You can however use your HSA or FSA funds and we offer many convenient financing solutions.
