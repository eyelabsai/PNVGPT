# Recovery and Activity Restrictions

## Can I still go on walks the week of my surgery?

Walking after surgery is usually okay as long as you don't sweat too much - we want to avoid sweat in the eye. The main restrictions include avoiding lifting or straining (anything that would require you to "bear down"), swimming, hot tubs, saunas, too much water (more than a drop or two) in your eye in the shower, or dirty dusty environments.

## When can I workout again?

We recommend you avoid strenuous activity (lifting or straining) for one week but light exercise such as walking is okay to resume as soon as you feel up to it. Just be careful about getting too much sweat in your eye for that first week also while you heal.

## Can I shower after surgery?

Yes! You absolutely can shower after surgery. The only consideration is to avoid getting too much water in your eyes for the first week after your procedure. An example would include turning away from the water when washing your face instead of letting the water run over your eyes.

## How do I wash my face?

The only consideration is to avoid getting too much water in your eyes for the first week after your procedure. Carefully washing your face in the sink using your hands and avoiding splashing a lot of water in your eyes is completely safe. An example in the shower would include turning away from the water when washing your face instead of letting the water run over your eyes.

## Can I wear makeup after surgery?

To ensure optimal healing, we recommend avoiding makeup for just 7 days after your surgery. SMILE is somewhat unique as it has no restriction and you can resume wearing makeup the next day.

## When can I put lash extensions in?

We recommend you wait 7 days before any cosmetic procedures around your eyes after any procedure. SMILE is somewhat unique as it has no restriction and you can resume any cosmetic activities the next day.

## Can I bend down to pick up after my dog?

This depends on which procedure we move forward with. We generally recommend keeping your head above your heart for the first week after your procedure. This restriction does not apply to laser vision correction like LASIK, SMILE, or PRK.

## How soon before I can travel / fly?

We recommend waiting 24 hours after your procedure to fly but every case is unique so we recommend talking to your doctor about your unique circumstance.

## Can I look at screens the next day?

Yes! Using your eyes will never hurt them. We just recommend you get as much rest and sleep as possible immediately after your procedure. You'll wake up the next day feeling refreshed and excited about your new vision!

## How soon can I drive after surgery?

This is dependent on state laws. For most states, this is around 20/40 vision in one eye without corrective lenses or contacts. While many patients are able to achieve this the day after surgery, healing is dependent on each unique eye. If your cataract is more dense, or you have pre-existing diseases of the cornea or retina it may take longer to achieve the best vision possible. For refractive surgery (EVO ICL, LASIK, PRK, SMILE, Lens Replacement), most vision recovers very quickly but again, there are reasons it may take longer for you to heal including the amount of prescription we're treating or any pre-existing conditions. Everybody heals differently but many people are seeing so well the next morning that they are able to drive themselves to their first post-op appointment! If you are uncertain if your vision is good enough to drive the first day, we will tell you if you meet the minimum required vision at that first appointment but many people recognize they're seeing better than they ever have that very first morning.
