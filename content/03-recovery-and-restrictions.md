# Recovery and Activity Restrictions

## Can I still go on walks the week of my surgery?

Walking after surgery is usually okay as long as you don't sweat too much - we want to avoid sweat in the eye. The main restrictions include avoiding lifting or straining (anything that would require you to "bear down"), swimming, hot tubs, saunas, too much water (more than a drop or two) in your eye in the shower, or dirty dusty environments.

This is dependent on state laws. For most states, this is around 20/40 vision in one eye without corrective lenses or contacts. While many patients are able to achieve this the day after surgery, healing is dependent on each unique eye. If your cataract is more dense, or you have pre-existing diseases of the cornea or retina it may take longer to achieve the best vision possible. For refractive surgery (EVO ICL, LASIK, PRK, SMILE, Lens Replacement), most vision recovers very quickly but again, there are reasons it may take longer for you to heal including the amount of prescription we're treating or any pre-existing conditions.
