# Keratoconus, CTAK, and Corneal Crosslinking

## Can I get LASIK or vision correction if I have keratoconus?

There are many ways to correct your vision if you have keratoconus! The exact treatments depend on the severity of your condition. 

For very mild disease, procedures like EVO ICL or laser vision correction like PRK combined with crosslinking can improve your vision substantially. For more advanced disease, we may recommend a procedure called CTAK. We may also recommend corneal crosslinking to stop the keratoconus from getting worse.

## What is CTAK?

CTAK, or Cornea Tissue Addition Keratoplasty, is a procedure where a custom segment of cornea is fit to fill in the area around the cone in keratoconus. This brings a lot more regularity to the surface of the eye and improves vision significantly. 

The procedure is painless and happens in two parts: a laser part, and a tissue addition part. Both take less than 5 minutes and most people notice a near immediate improvement. It can take a few months for everything to settle in place, but not only does vision improve, but the fit of specialty contact lenses can also improve if the keratoconus is severe. 

A good way to think of this is like how toys in the yard seem to disappear under a layer of snow. The CTAK is much like the snow, and the result is a nice flat surface.

## What is corneal crosslinking?

Corneal crosslinking uses a vitamin, riboflavin, and a special UV laser to generate a reaction that is like “glueing” the cornea in place and stops the keratoconus from getting worse. This is usually a very important step in the treatment of keratoconus.

## What is recovery like for CTAK?

Extremely easy! We will give you an eyedrop with an antibiotic and steroid in it that you will take for a month. For the first week, you’ll just need to take it easy and avoid getting too much water in your eye. The restrictions are identical to LASIK.

## What is the recovery like after corneal crosslinking, epi peels, or PRK?

You should expect some discomfort and limited vision in the eye for the first 3-7 days, but we place a contact lens on your eye that makes things much more comfortable. We also provide you with Tylenol 3 to help with the pain. 

For the first week, just take it easy by avoiding getting too much water in your eyes and avoid eye rubbing. We will remove the contact lens around 5 days and the vision should start improving at this time. We will discuss specifics with you at your consultation.
