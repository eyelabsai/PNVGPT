# Cataract Surgery FAQs

We're all born with a clear lens that sits behind the iris (the colored portion of the eye). As we age, this lens become cloudy and we call this cloudy lens a cataract. Cataract surgery involves replacing this cloudy lens with a new, clear lens. There are many types of lenses we can place under the surface of the eye and they essentially put the prescription under the surface of the eye! There are many types of lenses that we review in our Cataract Packet. Cataract surgery is one of the most common procedures performed in the United States every year.

Here is an overview of the process but it's important to know the specifics of your surgical plan may vary.

## What is cataract surgery?

Cataract surgery is a procedure to remove the eye's cloudy natural lens and replace it with a clear artificial lens (IOL) oftentimes with special technology that can help you stay out of glasses. Cataracts form when the natural lens becomes cloudy with age, causing blurry, dim, or yellowed vision. Modern cataract surgery is quick and painless and takes only 6 minutes per eye with vision improving almost immediately!

## When should I have cataract surgery?

You should consider surgery when cataracts begin to interfere with your daily life, such as reading, driving, recognizing faces, or doing the things you enjoy. There's no need to wait until vision is "bad enough"; cataract surgery can be performed as soon as you notice vision loss affecting quality of life. Early intervention can improve safety, comfort, and overall function.

## How long does cataract surgery take and what is recovery like?

At NuVision, each eye takes about 6 minutes, with patients going home the same day. Most notice better vision within 24 hours, though complete stabilization can take a week or two. Recovery is quick and easy, you'll use prescription eye drops for about a week and avoid heavy lifting, swimming, or rubbing the eye during early healing.

## Is cataract surgery painful?

No! Cataract surgery is performed with plenty of numbing drops and mild sedation, so you'll be awake but extremely comfortable. You shouldn't feel more than a gentle pressure or cool water during the procedure but no pain. Discomfort afterward is minimal and easily resolved with artificial tears if needed.

## What are the different types of cataract surgery?

There are two main types of cataract surgery:

Laser Cataract Surgery – uses laser precision for lens softening, improving accuracy and consistency. This type of surgery also allows us to fully correct astigmatism and use lenses with special technology to help you stay out of glasses!

Basic Manual Surgery – this is when all steps of the surgery are done by hand.

## What kinds of lens implants (IOLs) are available?

There are several advanced options:

Multifocal or trifocal lenses – provide clear vision at multiple distances.

Extended depth-of-focus (EDOF) lenses – smooth range from distance to near.

Light Adjustable Lens (LAL) – customizable after surgery for perfect fine-tuning.

Monofocal lenses – sharp focus at one distance.

We will help select the right lens based on your eyes and lifestyle goals!

## Do you have lenses that work for bifocal needs?

Yes, we have lenses that work for the bifocal need. Multifocal and extended depth-of-focus (EDOF) lenses are designed to provide clear vision at multiple distances, eliminating or significantly helping you stay out of bifocals. These advanced lens options allow you to see clearly at distance, intermediate, and near ranges, similar to what bifocal glasses provide but without needing glasses at all!

## Will I still need glasses after cataract surgery?

Many patients enjoy clear vision without glasses, especially with premium IOLs after Laser Cataract Surgery. However, you may still need reading glasses or mild correction depending on the type of lens that we will choose together. For example, multifocal lenses an provide independence from glasses under most circumstances but monofocal lenses might require you to still use readers. Cataract surgery is a great time to customize your vision to your lifestyle so we will make these decisions together.

## Is cataract surgery safe?

Yes! Cataract surgery is one of the safest and most common surgeries worldwide, with success rates exceeding 99.9%. If we are all lucky to live long enough, we will all get cataracts and eventually need cataract surgery so it's extremely common and benefits from 100s of years of innovation. Complications such as infection, inflammation, or retinal detachment are very rare and can be managed if detected early. Following post-op instructions helps ensure a smooth outcome.

## How much does cataract surgery cost and is it covered by insurance?

Cataract surgery is covered by Medicare and most insurance plans. Most patients also choose Laser Cataract Surgery and the use of lenses with special technology for more precise outcomes with more independence from glasses. These include out-of-pocket costs around a few thousand dollars per eye. We offer financing and HSA/FSA options if this type of surgery or use of these lenses best fit your goals and needs.

## How soon will I see clearly after cataract surgery?

WMost patients notice clearer, brighter vision within hours to a day after surgery. Vision may fluctuate slightly during the first week as the eye heals, but full clarity and stability typically occur within two to four weeks. You'll have several follow-up visits to monitor progress and adjust any remaining prescription if needed.

## Does cataract surgery correct astigmatism or presbyopia?

Yes! With the right lens choice and use of the laser we can significantly help you stay out of glasses. Toric lenses correct astigmatism, while multifocal or extended range lenses correct both distance and near vision, addressing presbyopia. We will tailor the IOL so you see clearly at multiple distances with minimal or no glasses afterward based on your personal goals, wants, and needs.

## Can cataracts come back after surgery?

No! A cataract happens when the lens behind the iris (color part of the eye) becomes cloudy. This most commonly happens normally with age. Cataract surgery involves replacing this cloudy lens with a brand new clear lens in the same capsule (or bag) that the old lens was in. Because the old, cloudy lens is gone, the cataract can NEVER come back! About 50% of the time, the capsule (or bag) that the lens is placed in can become cloudy. While the symptoms may be similar to those of a cataract, that is not what's happening, and this condition called PCO, posterior capsular opacification can be corrected in 20 seconds using a painless laser in the office.

## Can I have cataract surgery if I've had LASIK, PRK, or ICL?

Yes! Cataract surgery can still be safely performed in people with previous vision correction. We will use specialized calculations and imaging to select the correct IOL power, accounting for prior surgery. Many patients who've had LASIK or ICL still achieve excellent visual outcomes after cataract surgery!

## What are the risks of not having cataract surgery?

If left untreated, cataracts will only continue to worsen, leading to increasing blur, glare, and potential vision loss. Advanced cataracts can make daily activities unsafe, especially driving, and may become more risky to remove later. Timely surgery restores both clarity and confidence in everyday tasks!

## Preparation

We take all the measurements we need for any vision correction procedure at your consultation. It's important to stay out of soft contact lenses for at least five (5) days and three (3) weeks for rigid contact lenses. If you have special contact lenses, let us know when you schedule your consultation.

## What is cataract surgery like?

We take great care to make sure there is no discomfort at any point of the procedure. We typically first use a laser to perform some steps of the procedure before moving to a different room where the rest of the procedure is performed. We make two very small openings in the cornea (the clear part at the front of the eye), remove the cloudy natural crystalline lens and insert a new lens in the same capsule where the old lens was. The procedure itself usually takes only 6 minutes! The eyes are usually not done at the same time although it is possible under certain circumstances.

## How do I care for my eyes after cataract surgery?

After the procedure, you will have drops to take and will need to take it easy for a week. This means no lifting, straining, submerging your head in water, or touching/rubbing your eyes. We will see you one day, one week, and one month after surgery.
