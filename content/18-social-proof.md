# Why Choose Us / Social Proof

## How many procedures have you done?

Our surgeons have performed thousands of vision correction procedures and cataract surgeries. Vision correction is our specialty and ALL we do! This focused expertise means you're getting care from true specialists who have dedicated their careers to mastering these procedures.

## Do your surgeons have personal experience with these procedures?

Yes! Dr. Hirabayashi actually had ICL surgery himself, so he truly understands the patient experience from both sides. Many of our staff have also had vision correction procedures, so we can relate to the nervousness and excitement you might be feeling.
