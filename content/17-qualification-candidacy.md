# Qualification and Candidacy

## Am I a good candidate for vision correction?

Great question! Here's a quick self-check to see if you might be a candidate:
- Has your prescription been stable? (This usually happens around age 18, but can be before or after)
- Has your prescription been stable for at least a year?
- Are your eyes generally healthy?
- Are you looking for freedom from glasses or contacts?

The best way to know for sure is a consultation where we run comprehensive tests and scans. It takes a little over an hour and there's no obligation. Would you like to schedule one?

## What's the first step to getting LASIK (or other vision correction)?

The first step is a no-obligation consultation! During this visit, we will:
- Run comprehensive eye scans and measurements (about 30-45 minutes)
- Determine which procedures you qualify for
- Give you exact pricing for your specific situation
- Answer all your questions in person
- Meet with one of our surgeon specialists

## How do I know which procedure is right for me?

Every eye is unique, which is why we offer a comprehensive consultation. During your visit, we'll run tests to determine:
- Your exact prescription and eye measurements
- Corneal thickness and shape
- Overall eye health
- Which procedures you're a candidate for

Based on the results, our surgeons will recommend the best options for YOUR specific eyes and lifestyle goals. The consultation has no obligation and there's no pressure to move forward.

## How do I schedule a consultation?

Scheduling is easy! You can:
- Call us at (210) 585-2020
- Schedule online through our website
- We'll find a time that works for your schedule

We require a $50 deposit to hold your appointment, which gets applied to the cost of your procedure if you qualify and decide to move forward.

## What happens during the consultation?

Your consultation typically takes a little over an hour. Here's what to expect:
1. Check-in and paperwork (we try to minimize this!)
2. Comprehensive eye measurements and scans
3. Vision and prescription testing
4. Dilation (we'll "un-dilate" you before you leave)
5. Review of scans with Dr. Hirabayashi or Dr. Virdi
6. Discussion of your options, pricing, and next steps
7. Time for all your questions

You'll leave knowing exactly what procedures you qualify for and what they would cost.

## Is there a cost for the consultation?

The consultation has no obligation. We do require a $50 deposit to hold your appointment with our surgeon specialists, which gets applied to the cost of your procedure if you qualify and decide to move forward.
