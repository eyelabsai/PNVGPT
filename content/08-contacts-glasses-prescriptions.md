# Contact Lenses, Glasses, and Prescriptions

## How long do I have to stay out of contact lenses?

You can wear contacts on the day of your evaluation. After the evaluation, you are free to wear contact lenses again, but please remove them 3 days prior to your procedure and only wear glasses at that time if you have a pair that will work! On the day of the procedure, do not wear contacts. You'll need someone to drive you on the day of the procedure, so don't worry about getting here safely.

## Can I still wear contacts afterwards?

You can still wear contact lenses after your procedure but our goal is for you not to need to! We advise you to be careful of products like colored contact lenses though. For procedures to treat keratoconus such as crosslinking or CTAK, specialty contact lenses can actually fit better after the procedure. We do recommend you wait 3 months after crosslinking and 3-6 months after CTAK to have any specialty contact lenses made though. Temporary soft contact lenses can be used in the meantime though.

## Will I have the same glasses prescription?

No! That's part of the magic of cataract surgery. We are essentially making your prescription "0" so your old glasses will not work after surgery.
