# Medications and Eye Drops

## Why doesn't my insurance cover my eyedrops?

We prefer a special formulation of the eyedrops that minimizes the amount you need to take every day.

## What type of eyedrops do you give me?

We will provide you with a combination eyedrop after your procedure that includes an antibiotic to prevent infection and anti-inflammatory medication to expedite your healing.

## Do I need to get anything from the pharmacy?

We will provide you with all the drops you need on the day of your procedure!

## Can I take my "x" medicine the day of surgery?

Yes, you should take all medications as you normally would with a small sip of water. No need to discontinue any medications, even blood thinners, as these procedures do not involve any blood.

## What if I take insulin or have diabetes?

If you take insulin, we'll do our best to plan your procedure in the morning to not disrupt your schedule.

## Can I still use (X prescription) eyedrops?

Yes! We encourage you to continue using all your eyedrops as you normally would after your procedure. Whether they're for dry eye or glaucoma, your doctor will adjust your medications as needed sometime in the postoperative period. There are always exceptions so it's important to ask your doctor about continuing specific medications if you have concerns before your surgery.
